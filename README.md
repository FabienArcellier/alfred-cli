## Alfred

Alfred is an extensible building tool that can replace a Makefile or Fabric.

It allows you to build your **continuous integration scripts** in python, and much more. You can replace any scripts using the best of both worlds, shell and python.

Want to try and look for inspiration, here are examples of commands that I implement in my projects :

```bash
alfred ci # run your own continuous integration process
alfred publish # publish a package on pypi
alfred run # run your app
alfred db:init # initialize a database
alfred db:migrate # plays your migrations on your database
...
```

## Getting started

To configure a python project to use alfred, here is the procedure:

```bash
pip3 install alfred-cli
alfred init
```

Une première commande a été crée pour vous. Elle vous permet de tester alfred.

```bash
alfred hello_world --name "Fabien"
```

A file `.alfred.toml` will be initialized at the root of the repository.

## Cookbook

### Write your first command

You can add your command in a new module in `./alfred`.
In this example we will add the command `alfred lint` :

*alfred/lint.py*
```python
import alfred

@alfred.command('lint', help="validate your product using mypy")
def lint():
    pylint = alfred.sh('mypy', "mypy is not installed")
    alfred.run(pylint, ["src/alfred"])
```

### Write your first workflow

*alfred/ci.py*
```python
import alfred

@alfred.command('ci', help="execute continuous integration process")
def ci(verbose: bool):
    alfred.invoke_command('lint')
    alfred.invoke_command('tests')
```

## Benefits

### Alfred scales with your team

Alfred grows with your team. You can start with one command and then add more. When you feel that your command file is too crowded, you can restructure it into several files, or even separate it into several subfolders. Alfred is able to search all your orders by scanning a folder and its subfolders. It's all configurable.

### Alfred likes mono-repository

Alfred is built with the idea of being usable in a mono-repository which brings together several python, react, node projects in the same code repository. You can create several alfred sub-projects. At the root of the project, you will have access to all the commands of all the subprojects using the subproject name ``alfred project1 ci``.

## Behind the scene

Alfred rely heavily on click and plumblum :

* [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/)
* [plumblum](https://plumbum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Why using alfred instead of Makefile or Bash scripts

One of the advantages of `bash` and `Makefile` is their native presence in many environments. By default, a `Makefile` allows you to segment these commands efficiently. Autocompletion is first-citizen  feature. Alfred doesn't have it yet.

Alfred allows you to create more complex commands than with Make. From the start, you benefit from a formatted documentation for each of your orders. It is easy to create one command per file  thanks to auto discovery. You can see an implementation in this repository in [`alfred_cmd/`](alfred/).

Alfred allows you to mix shell code with python instructions. In some cases, it allows you to perform efficient processing on API calls. You can use either the cli (for git, ...) or pythons libraries depending on the nature of the treatment you want to perform.

In our development process, we frequently need to operate on application with several process (frontend in react, server in flask, two external service in flask). To mount those process, we use `honcho` with alfred to load `Procfile` that will manage those process.

## Why not using alfred

If you want to create a cli you will distribute, alfred is not designed for that. I won't recommand as well to use it to build a data application even if you can use python and many library.

Alfred command can import only installed library. You can't use relative import. That makes difficult to share code between your commands.

## The latest version

You can find the latest version to ...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FabienArcellier/alfred-cli.git
```

## Cookbook

### Display the commands really executed

You can display the commands really executed, either to debug the arguments,
either to run in your terminal again with other attributes.

The option `d` / `--debug` display all the shell commands that are executed by
`alfred.run()` in your alfred command.

```bash
$ alfred -d ci

.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

OK
```

### Customize a command for a specific OS

Alfred can run a specific part of the build for an OS,
for example to only run the linter on a linux machine.

```python
@alfred.command('ci', help="execute continuous integration process of alfred")
@alfred.option('-v', '--verbose', is_flag=True)
def ci(verbose: bool):
    if alfred.is_posix():
        alfred.invoke_command('lint', verbose=verbose)
    else:
        print("linter is not supported on non posix platform as windows")

    alfred.invoke_command('tests', verbose=verbose)
```

the ``alfred.is_posix``, ``alfred.is_linux``, ``alfred.is_macos``, ``alfred.is_windows`` functions allow you to quickly
target the environment on which specific processing must be performed.

### Override environment variables

```python
@alfred.command('ci', help="execute continuous integration process of alfred")
def ci():
    with alfred.env(SCREEN="display"):
        bash = alfred.sh("bash")
        bash.run("-c" "echo $SCREEN")
```

#### Add directories into pythonpath

Adding a folder in the pythonpath variable allows you to expose packages without declaring them in the manifest.

This pattern is useful with poetry to be able to reuse the code of the package tests in this one for example.

The ``alfred.pythonpath`` decorator adds the project root. You can save specific folders here.

```python
@alfred.command('ci', help="execute continuous integration process of alfred")
@alfred.pythonpath()
def ci():
    bash = alfred.sh("bash")
    alfred.run(bash, ["-c" "echo $SCREEN"])
```

```python
@alfred.command('ci', help="execute continuous integration process of alfred")
@alfred.pythonpath(['tests'], append_project=False)
def ci():
    bash = alfred.sh("bash")
    alfred.run(bash, ["-c", "echo $SCREEN"])
```

```python
@alfred.command('ci', help="execute continuous integration process of alfred")
def ci():
    with alfred.pythonpath():
        bash = alfred.sh("bash")
        alfred.run(bash, ["-c", "echo $SCREEN"])
```


## Developper guideline

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

```
$ alfred

### Run the linter and the unit tests

Before commit or send a pull request, you have to execute `pylint` to check the syntax
of your code and run the unit tests to validate the behavior.

```bash
alfred ci
```
