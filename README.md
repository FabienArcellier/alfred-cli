### Quick-start

In this quick-start, we will create 2 commands to automate the launch of the linter and unit tests.

```bash
$ alfred --new pylint src/myapp
```

```text
Name of the command ?: lint
Description of `lint` command ?: run linter on codebase
Module of `lint` command ? [alfred/commands.py]:
>>> @alfred.command('lint', help="run linter on codebase")
>>> def pylint():
>>>   alfred.run('pylint src/myapp')

Do you want to create the following `lint` command in `alfred/commands.py` ?  (y, n) [y]: y
```

```bash
$ alfred --new pytest tests/unit
```

```text
Name of the command ?: tests
Description of `tests` command ?: run unit tests on codebase
Module of `tests` command ? [alfred/commands.py]:
>>> @alfred.command('tests', help="run unit tests on codebase")
>>> def tests():
