execute the following statement to activate completion.

>>> eval "$(_ALFRED_COMPLETE=fish_source alfred | source)"

alfred has detected you are using fish ({shell}).

You have to add this statement to a completion file to install completion permanently.
Configuring completion in fish should be done in ~/.config/fish/completions/alfred.fish
